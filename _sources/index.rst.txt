If you are new to Ubuntu system administration, this is the place to start. 
We document in this 'recipe book' the common tasks to manage Ubuntu machines
based on our experience on using them in our research group. Ubuntu is our 
linux distribution of choice because it is widely supported by the community
and is used in physical and virtualized environments. 


Tested on Ubuntu Version: 16.04 LTS (64-bit), 18.04 LTS (64-bit)
